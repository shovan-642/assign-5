১) What is DOM and what is the purpose of DOM?

DOM (Document Object Model) is an API(Application Programming Interface) that represents the HTML document in the form of the Tree structure such that programs can access and change the style and structure of the HTML document. The DOM object is automatically created by the web browser itself upon opening an HTML web page.

one of the main purpose for developing the DOM is to maintain a standard programming interface for HTML and XML documents, which is language-independent. Setting and maintaining this standard enables programmers to create or navigate these types of documents and modify their elements predictably, using any type of language or development environment.

৩) What is event bubble?

The Event bubbling in JavaScript is a type of event propagation. The event triggers the innermost target element and consecutively triggers the parent element of the target element in the same hierarchy until it triggers the outermost element.

৪) What is a callback function and why will you use it?

A JavaScript callback is a function which is to be executed after another function has finished execution.

We need callback functions because many JavaScript actions are asynchronous, which means they don't really stop the program (or a function) from running until they're completed, as you're probably used to. Instead, it will execute in the background while the rest of the code runs.
